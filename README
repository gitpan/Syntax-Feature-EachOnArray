NAME
    Syntax::Feature::EachOnArray - Emulate each(@array) on Perl < 5.12

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
     # This can run on Perls older than 5.12 and have no effect on 5.12+

     use syntax 'each_on_array';

     my @a = (qw/a b c/);
     while (my ($idx, $item) = each @a) {
         ...
     }

DESCRIPTION
    Beginning with 5.12, Perl supports each() on array. This syntax
    extension emulates the support on older Perls.

    syntax

    Syntax::Feature::KeysOnArray

    Syntax::Feature::ValuesOnArray

    Array::Each::Override (written in 2007, before Perl 5.10). Didn't find
    out about this module until after I uploaded
    Syntax::Feature::EachOnArray to CPAN. This module, although not using
    the syntax syntax, does everything
    Syntax::Feature::{Each,Keys,Values}OnArray does and more. Take a look at
    it.
